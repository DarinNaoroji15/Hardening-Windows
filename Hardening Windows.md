# Hardening Windows

In this lab I will successfully exploit and harden a Windows Server using Nmap and Metasploit. 

Exploitation 

1. Boot and run your Kali Linux Virtual Machine. 

2. Click and open the terminal.

3. Once the terminal is opened, we are going to find our IP address. To do so, type in the following command: ifconfig eth0

Result of step 3

4. Next we are going to ping the Windows Server.

Type in the following command: ping 192.168.1.100 -c 4

Result of step 4

5. Now we are going to scan the Windows Server.

Type in the following command: ping 192.168.1.100

<img width="398" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19f9086d-6f15-49aa-88dc-0adff8401308" />

Result of step 5. To exit the scan click Ctrl+Z.

6. We are going to create a fake mp3 file.

Type in the following command: echo this is not a real mp3 file > 8675309.mp3

7. Type the following command to connect to the ftp server: ftp 192.168.1.100

After connecting, log in as the Name ftp for example. For the password, type "ftp" for password or you can just press Enter (*note I am typing ftp). Any credentials will be accepted if anonymous access is allowed.

Result of step 7

8. Now type the following commands in the FTP prompt.

ftp>ls

ftp> get flag.txt

ftp> put 8675309.mp3

ftp> bye

Result of step 8

9. To view the flag.

Type in the following command: cat flag.txt

10. We are going to scan the Windows Server.

Type in the following command: nmap 192.168.1.100

Result of step 10

11. We also see that HTTP is open by the list of other ports. Most people use HTTPS now. We will now test to see if the website is functioning for company purposes or has not been setup. Next we are going to pull up the Web Browser.

12. Minimize the cmd prompt. Click the Windows Key on the toolbar on the bottom of the screen. Click the Web Broswer icon once the start menu opens.

Result of step 12

13. In the URL bar, type in http://192.168.1.100 or 192.168.1.100

Result of step 14

15. We also see that File and Print Sharing is open by the list of other ports.

Type the following command to enumerate the shares: smbclient -L \\192.168.1.100

Press enter after the prompt of entering a password is asked.

16. Follow step 12 again.

17. Type in the URL bar: https://www.google.com and search up smb exploit windows server 2016.
